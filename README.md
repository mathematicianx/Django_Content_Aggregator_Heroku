# Django_Content_Aggregator_Heroku

Content agregator page made in Django.
It uses a webscraper which connects to few local pages (local newspapers, news pages and local city hall) to extract latest news.
It also scrapes two local cinemas extracting which movies premiere at current day and what are the premiere dates.
It also uses Filmweb API written by lopezloo go get filmweb score and display it next to movie title.

There is also a basic webforum for local discussions and local advert board.
Using forum and ads is free, but login is required.
